          The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of the
          Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day. Prior to
          European colonization, the lands encompassing present-day Canada were
          inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples, with distinct trade
          networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some
          of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first
          European arrivals and have been discovered through archeological
          investigations. From the late 15th century, French and British
          expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within
          North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of
          New France was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in
          1608. France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the
          United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the Seven Years'
          War. The now British Province of Quebec was divided into Upper and
          Lower Canada in 1791 and reunified in 1841. In 1867, the Province of
          Canada was joined with two other British colonies of New Brunswick and
          Nova Scotia through Confederation, forming a self-governing entity
          named Canada. The new country expanded by incorporating other parts of
          British North America, finishing with Newfoundland and Labrador in
          1949. Although responsible government had existed in Canada since
          1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until
          the end of the First World War. The passing of the Statute of
          Westminster in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with
          the United Kingdom. After the Constitution was patriated in 1982, the
          final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were
          removed. Canada currently consists of ten provinces and three
          territories and is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional
          monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Over centuries,
          elements of Indigenous, French, British and more recent immigrant
          customs have combined to form a Canadian culture that has also been
          strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic
          neighbour, the United States. Since the conclusion of the Second World
          War, Canadians have supported multilateralism abroad and socioeconomic
          development.
