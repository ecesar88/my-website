            There are more than 2,800 hockey rinks in Canada. However, almost
            twice as many kids under 14 years play soccer than hockey.
            Ice-Hockey is still the second most practised sport in Canada for
            all over 15 years of age. Ice hockey comes after golf, but before
            soccer!
